I have successfully developed the final project "Fantasy Cricket Game" as per the given guidelines.
A simple database file is createed whic contains 5 tables for 5 different matches,1 table for player details and 1 table for player stats.
2 ui files has been created using qt designer application containing multiple labels,line edits.horizontal layouts,radiobuttons,line widget and push button.
Those ui files are converted into the py files usimg command prompt and the several functions are created to meet the given project requirements.
The second py file  is linked to the first one for evaluation window,the rest menu options are being accessible using several dialog boxes.
The fully funtional GUI application open via "Final.py" pyhon file and "evls.py" open evaluation window.\
The error are shown in dialog boxes and are as per the cricket rules.
Thank You.
